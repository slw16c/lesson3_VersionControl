            </h2>
            <p class="lead">What is version control? Version control is a system that contains all files for a project. The system can record changes made to the files and can store the older versions of them for later use. The use of a Version control repository can be beneficial for web designers because they will always have the older versions of their layouts. Version control is also good for group projects because they allow each and ever person working on the project to have access to these files. The topic interests me and is relevant to the course because it provides an easy access for group projects. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Local version control repository is a repository that is on a local computer for a single user. Many people, when they wanted to copy files on to a server for like a backup, they would just upload to a time-stamped directory, but they were error prone. Local version control system was then created to alleviate those errors. Local version control repositories are a simple directory that lets out keep track of our files. One issue with using the local version control is if you wanted to collaborate with other people. Local version controls are relevant to the course because man of us in this class are probably using these repositories for classes. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Centralized Version Control Systems</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Centralized version control systems were created to help with the issue that using a localized version control had, what was the ability to collaborate with many different users. Centralized version control systems are a remote repository that is a repository that is on a centralized server that can be used by multiple people that are allowed to have access to the files. These repositories allow the many users to see what was worked on. Unfortunately, these also have downsides. While using a centralized server, if the server goes down, nobody can use the CVCS and can’t backup any data while the server is down. Centralized version controls are relevant to the course because many of us in this class and in IT or ICT classes are probably using these repositories for classes.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The centralized version control systems centralized server problem is now able to be addressed with a distributed version control system. Distributed version control systems are like the centralized version control systems, they allow many users the use of a repository and see the changes made, but if a server dies or crashes whilst in the middle of collaborating, the data can be copied back to the server to get is restored. Every user using the DVCS will have a copy of the data stored locally on their device. These repositories are relevant to the course, because this lesson made us use one. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">One type of a distributed version control is Git. According to git-scm.com, Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.  Git was created in 2005 by a community of Linux developers. Some advantages to having Git is its fast, simple, fully distributed, can handle large projects, and it can stop an unintentional overwrite to a file. Git is fascinating because it was created because a company that allowed free use of BitKeeper revoked the free-of-charge status. Git is relevant to the course because it’s the DVCS we used in this lesson.</p>
